### Project Title
Bikeshare data program

### Description
This program allows user entry to analyze bikeshare data from
3 cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington.
The user can select to see either all information from a particular city, or can choose to see what happened on a particular day or a particular for the city chosen.

### Files used
The data files used are:
chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv.
These files must be in the same folder as the program.

### Credits
The initial template for this program came from the Udacity Data Analysis course.
